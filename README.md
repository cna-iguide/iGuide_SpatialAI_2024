# iGuide_SpatialAI_2024

## Overview

**iGuide_SpatialAI_2024** is a project focused on spatial artificial intelligence. The project comprises three main Jupyter notebooks: [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb), [`utils.ipynb`](utils.ipynb), and [`unet.ipynb`](unet.ipynb). The primary workflow is executed from the [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb) notebook, which leverages utility functions and a U-Net model for spatial data processing.

**Note:** You can install these libraries using the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) in this repository.

\* These are standard built-in Python (3.4 or higher) libraries that **do not** need to be installed separately. 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cna-iguide/iGuide_SpatialAI_2024.git
    cd iGuide_SpatialAI_2024
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook server:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Navigate to the [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb) notebook and open it.

3. Execute the cells in [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb) to run the project. This notebook will call functions from [`utils.ipynb`](utils.ipynb) and use the U-Net model from [`unet.ipynb`](unet.ipynb) to process spatial data.

## Usage

### [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb)

This notebook is the main entry point for the project. It orchestrates the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

### [`utils.ipynb`](utils.ipynb)

Contains utility functions for data preprocessing, visualization, and dataset management. Includes both internal and public functions with detailed docstrings and comments for clarity.

### [`unet.ipynb`](unet.ipynb)

Implements the U-Net model and its associated functions for image segmentation. Includes both internal and public functions with detailed docstrings and comments for clarity.
